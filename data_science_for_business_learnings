Types of Tasks in Data Science
 • Classification and class probability estimation: Predicting which of a small set of classes an individual belongs to.
 • Regression ("value estimation"): Estimating or predicting the numerical value of a variable for an individual.
 • Similarity Matching: Identifying individuals who are similar based on the data known about them.
 • Clustering: Grouping individuals by their similarity, not driven by a specific purpose.
 • Co-occurrence Grouping: Finding associations between entities based on transactions involving them.
 • Profiling: Characterizing the typical behavior of an individual, group, or population.
 • Link Prediction: Predicting connections between data items, suggesting that a link should exist and estimating its strength.
 • Data Reduction: Replacing a large dataset with a smaller one that retains most of the important information.
 • Causal Modeling: Understanding what events or actions influence others.
